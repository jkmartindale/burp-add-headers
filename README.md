# burp-add-headers

Session handling rule to add headers to requests. Intended to work like [Add Custom Header](https://github.com/lorenzog/burpAddCustomHeader) but you can add multiple headers. Also an experiment in faithfully recreating Burp's UI for ease of use/productivity. Lot of stuff still unimplemented, but is functional for static headers.
